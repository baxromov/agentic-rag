Title: Network Access Required - Development Environment Blocked

Priority: High
Type: Access Request
Component: Firewall / Network Security

Description:
Development environment cannot function due to firewall blocking package repositories. Need whitelist approval.

Requirements:
Whitelist outbound HTTPS (port 443) to:
- pypi.org (Python packages)
- files.pythonhosted.org (Python packages CDN)
- registry-1.docker.io (Docker Hub)
- auth.docker.io (Docker authentication)
- production.cloudflare.docker.com (Docker CDN)
- huggingface.co (AI models)
- cdn-lfs.huggingface.co (AI model downloads)
- registry.npmjs.org (NPM packages)
- github.com (Git repositories)
- raw.githubusercontent.com (GitHub content)

Whitelist DNS (UDP port 53) to:
- 8.8.8.8 (Google DNS)
- 1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare DNS)

Business Impact:
Cannot install dependencies or build applications. Development work 100% blocked.

Security Notes:
- All traffic encrypted (HTTPS/TLS)
- Official repositories only
- Outbound connections only
- Industry standard tools

Acceptance Criteria:
1. Can run: curl https://pypi.org (returns 200 OK)
2. Can run: docker pull python:3.12-slim (downloads successfully)
3. Can run: pip install requests (installs successfully)

Alternative Solution:
If direct access denied, provide corporate proxy configuration:
- HTTP_PROXY URL
- HTTPS_PROXY URL
- NO_PROXY settings

Urgency: Critical - blocks all development
