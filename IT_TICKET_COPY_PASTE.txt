Subject: Network Access Request - Docker Development Environment

Request Type: Firewall Whitelist / Proxy Exception

PURPOSE:
Enable Docker-based AI application development with Python, Node.js, and machine learning models.

- 8.8.8.8
- 1.1.1.1

BUSINESS JUSTIFICATION:
Required for installing development dependencies and building containerized applications. Without access, cannot install Python packages (pip), pull Docker images, or download AI models. Blocks development work.

SECURITY:
- All traffic HTTPS encrypted
- Official repositories only
- No incoming connections
- Outbound only

URGENCY: High - blocking development work

ALTERNATIVE:
If direct access not possible, please provide corporate HTTP/HTTPS proxy settings.

Thank you.
