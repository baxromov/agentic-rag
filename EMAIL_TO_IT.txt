Subject: URGENT: Network Access Needed for Development

Hi IT Security Team,

I'm blocked from development work due to firewall restrictions. Need access to install packages and build Docker containers.

WHAT TO DO:
Whitelist these 10 domains for HTTPS (port 443) outbound traffic:

1. pypi.org
2. files.pythonhosted.org
3. registry-1.docker.io
4. auth.docker.io
5. production.cloudflare.docker.com
6. huggingface.co
7. cdn-lfs.huggingface.co
8. registry.npmjs.org
9. github.com
10. raw.githubusercontent.com

Plus DNS servers: 8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1 (UDP port 53)

WHY:
- pypi.org = Install Python packages (pip install)
- registry-1.docker.io = Download Docker containers
- huggingface.co = Download AI models
- registry.npmjs.org = Install JavaScript packages
- github.com = Clone code repositories

SECURITY:
✓ All encrypted HTTPS traffic
✓ Official repositories only (Google, Docker, PyPI)
✓ No incoming connections
✓ Standard development tools

WITHOUT ACCESS:
Cannot install dependencies, build Docker images, or develop applications. Work is completely blocked.

ALTERNATIVE:
If you can't whitelist domains, please provide:
- HTTP proxy: http://proxy.company.com:PORT
- HTTPS proxy: http://proxy.company.com:PORT

This is blocking critical development work. Please approve ASAP.
